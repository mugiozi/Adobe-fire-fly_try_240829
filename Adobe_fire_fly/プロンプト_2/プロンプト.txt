(Title)
Anime-style seaside hut (Composition)
A side view from inside a corner room by the sea. (Inside the room)
The room is a little dim, and the entire corner room is made up of windows.
Below the windows is a brick wall, with some pretty ornaments
hanging on it. (Outside the window, the sea)
Outside the window you can see the blue sky with a few clouds,
and a few seagulls flying.
The sea spray dances in a slightly dreamy way, but not too much.
